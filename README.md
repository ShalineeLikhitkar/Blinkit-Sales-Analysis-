# 📊 Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project

Welcome to my **Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard**, built using **Power BI**. This project focuses on understanding key business metrics, customer preferences, and outlet performance trends using sales data from a grocery delivery business.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze Blinkit's sales data and uncover:
- How different fat content items perform
- Outlet size and tier-wise sales distribution

## 💡 Key Business Questions

❓ What is the average customer rating?  
❓ How much revenue is generated per sale?  
❓ What are the total sales and items sold overall?  
❓ Which outlet tier and outlet size perform best?  
❓ Which fat type (Regular/Low) contributes most to sales?
